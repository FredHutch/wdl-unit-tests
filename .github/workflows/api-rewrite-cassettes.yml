            Updated vcr cassettes

            Via event: ${{ github.event_name }}
            - If "workflow_dispatch" it was triggered by a person clicking the "Run workflow" button in the GitHub UI Actions tab
            - If "schedule" it was triggered by a scheduled event (see the `.github/workflows/api-rewrite-cassettes.yml` file for the schedule)

            Review, then either merge or close this PR
            - A cursory review is sufficient (e.g., just look at a few cassette `*yml` files; though if anything is concerning, please investigate and discuss with Scott or Sean)

            What is this?
            - This is a pull request that updates the vcr cassettes for the Cromwell API tests. Read more about how tests work in the [README](https://github.com/FredHutch/wdl-unit-tests?tab=readme-ov-file#tests). We use the `vcrpy` Python library to record and replay HTTP requests and responses (called "cassettes"). These cassettes need to be re-recorded every so often to ensure that tests reflect the reality of the PROOF and Cromwell APIs.

            Note that workflows are not run for this PR because [actions cannot trigger other workflows](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/issues/48)
